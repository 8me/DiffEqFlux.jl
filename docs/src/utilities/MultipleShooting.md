# Multiple Shooting Functionality

!!! note

	The form of multiple shooting found here is a specialized form known
 	as data shooting which assumes full observability of the underlying
  dynamics and lack of noise. For a more general implementation of
  multiple shooting, see the [JuliaSimModelOptimizer](https://help.juliahub.com/jsmo/stable/)
  For an implementation more directly tied to parameter estimation against data,
  see [DiffEqParamEstim.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqParamEstim/stable/).
